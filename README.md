### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ali, a 19 year old student, programming enthusiast, and avid gamer who enjoys messing around with the modding space in a variety of games, and dabbling in scripts and tools for usability and modularity!

I am currently attending TMU (formerly Ryerson), majoring in the Computer Science program. I have a lot of experience in C/C++, Python, Java. Beyond that, I have ample experience in C#, Rust, HTML/CSS, and JS. I am interested in learning more about Rust and C#. I am also deeply interested (but not very experienced) in graphical programming, and using APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan for rendering. I place a strong emphasis on performance above all else, and strive to optimize to the absolute maximum for many of my programs.

I'm super open to learning new ideas and fundamentals. I pride myself on being open-minded and accepting of many new ideas and perspectives, and will incorporate them into my standard of programming. Most importantly, I am willing to learn and improve myself in all aspects.
